## 'The only bar that doesn't sell alcohol.'
My very first full-stack application. Buy and sell items from thousands of users all geolocated around you. Below is a readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc. 

## Approach Taken
Started by learning and experimenting with Google Maps API manipulation. Then, I implemented the users signup/login forms courtesy of [Bobby King](https://github.com/gittheking) at General Assembly.
